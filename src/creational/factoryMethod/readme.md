### Definition:
**Factory method** is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of
 creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead
of direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to
change the class of objects that will be created (**See Example-2 Canvas.java**).
