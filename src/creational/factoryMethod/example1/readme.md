## NOTES:
- Open-Closed Principle is violated by:
    - **ShapeFactory** class violates this principle because every time 
    a new implementation for the shape is created this ShapeFactory class will 
    require modification. Therefore this is not closed for modification.
    
- Example-2 is a better way.
