## Definition:
- Composite pattern lets clients tread individual objects as well
as their compositions uniformly.
- It is used when we can represent objects in a tree/hierarchical
structure. (Objects are made up of multiple objects).
- It composes objects into tree structures. Anything that is
suitable to be modeled as a tree structure is a potential 
candidate for composite pattern.
