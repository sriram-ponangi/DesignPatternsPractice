## Definition:
- Facade pattern is used to hide the complexities of the
underlying system/library/framework to provide an interface
to the client using which the client can access the system.

- **In this pattern we create a single simplified (but limited)
class which has methods required by the client
and these methods delegates calls to methods of existing 
system classes.**
